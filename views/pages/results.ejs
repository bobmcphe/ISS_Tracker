    <div class="viewing">
      <p> Since the ISS is the 3rd brightest object in the sky, it can often be seen even in urban areas
        when it is in view at 40 degrees or higher. The best viewing is when it passes, over the viewer 
        one hour after dusk or one hour before dawn. Longer passes and clear skies/few clouds are ideal.
      </p>

      <br>
        
        <p>Tip:   If you know the height in degrees at which the space station will appear, remember that 90 degrees is 
        directly over your head. Any number less than 90 degrees will mean that the station will appear 
        somewhere between the horizon and the 90 degree mark. Alternatively, you can stretch out your fist 
        at armâ€™s length toward the horizon, which is equivalent to about 10 degrees. Then, just use the 
        appropriate number of fist-heights to find the location marker, e.g., four fist-lengths from the 
        horizon would be equivalent to about 40 degrees.

          contacts with earth-bound radio amateurs.  The crew's usual waking 
          period is 0730 - 1930 UTC. The most common times to find a crew member 
          making casual periods are about one hour after waking and before sleeping, 
          when they have personal time. They're usually free most of the weekend, as well.
